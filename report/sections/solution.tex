\section{Solutions}
To achieve the aforementioned objectives, we made specific design considerations 
regarding the various components of the cluster.

We chose to use \textit{libvirt} as the Node Manager, allowing abstraction from the 
hypervisor and enabling greater service scalability.

For ensuring availability, we implemented the Raft protocol to manage distributed 
consensus. This protocol also ensures the homogeneity of the nodes.

Finally, we developed two CLIs (Command Line Interfaces): one for control/configuration
and another for end-user interaction.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first CLI is designed for system administrators to manage the cluster.
	\item The second CLI is intended for end users to access the features offered by the cluster.
\end{itemize}
