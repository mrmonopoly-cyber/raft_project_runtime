\section{Goals}
As previously mentioned, our goal is to create a cluster that is both reliable and easy to configure and install.

Specifically, the system must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Enable service scalability by allowing the addition or removal of nodes without interrupting the provided services.
	\item Ensure service availability even in the event of failures, whether at the physical level (servers, network) or the software level (crashes of the operating system or the application itself).
	\item Integrate tools for administrators to interact with the cluster.
	\item Eliminate any single points of failure.
	\item Ensure that all nodes in the cluster are structurally identical.
	\item Implement a distributed filesystem within the cluster as a demonstration.
\end{itemize}
